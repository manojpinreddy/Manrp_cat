# About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Manoj Reddy!  
Iâ€™m exploring the world of **Git** and **GitHub**, learning how developers collaborate globally on projects.

## ðŸ›  Skills & Learning
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: `Git branching`, `pull requests`, and `Markdown formatting`  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m practicing how to:
  - Create and switch between branches using `git checkout`
  - Stage changes with `git add`
  - Commit updates with `git commit -m "message"`
  - Push to a remote repository with `git push`
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: how to review code before merging a branch

## ðŸ“š Fun GitHub Facts
- Every repository has a **default branch** (often `main`) â€” this is the "official" version of the code.
- A **pull request** isnâ€™t about pulling from you â€” itâ€™s asking *someone else* to pull your changes into their branch.
- You can use **GitHub Issues** to track tasks, bugs, or ideas inside your project.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Contribute to an **open-source project** by forking, cloning, and making a pull request.
- Learn how to review someoneâ€™s changes before merging.
- Create a personal project that uses GitHub Actions for automation.

#### ðŸ“« Connect
- GitHub: [github.com/manojreddy](https://github.com/manojreddy)
- Fun fact: This README is written in **Markdown** â€” the same format used in most GitHub documentation!
